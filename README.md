# drg-mods
Various mods for the video game Deep Rock Galactic. A project in [RCOS](https://github.com/rcos) for the Spring 2023 semester. 

Ideas are organized in [Issues](https://github.com/Patch4747/drg-mods/issues). 

## Developing a mod
1. First, please open an issue describing your mod idea. Others might provide comments to help build the idea. 
2. Create a new branch off `main` with a short, descriptive name. This is your working space. 
3. Document your development (i.e., any deviations from the original idea) by adding comments to the open issue.
4. Once you have completed the mod, submit a pull request with your branch. You may receive some comments/suggestions to your work. 
5. After resolving any issues with your branch, the project lead will merge with `main` and you will see your mod added to the project! 

## Using a mod
1. Download the desired `.pak` file from this repo. 
2. Now find the `Mods` folder in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Mods` in your files. Add a folder inside the Mods folder with the same name as the mod you are installing. Then, place the `.pak` file inside the folder you just created.
3. If DRG is currently running, exit and re-open the game.
4. Upon opening the game, you will see a prompt about using mods. Follow the instructions.
5. Now, you are free to enjoy your mod!

# 2. Now put the `.pak` file in the `Paks` directory in the game files. To get here, you can either go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Content\Paks` (on Windows) OR right click on the Deep Rock Galactic on Steam, under `Manage` select `"Browse local files"`. Then you can navigate to the `Paks` directory from there.
