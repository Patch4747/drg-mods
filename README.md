# drg-mods
Various mods for the video game Deep Rock Galactic. A project in [RCOS](https://github.com/rcos) for the Spring 2023 semester. 

Ideas are organized in [Issues](https://github.com/Patch4747/drg-mods/issues). 

## Developing a mod
1. First, please open an issue describing your mod idea. Others might provide comments to help build the idea. 
2. Create a new branch off `main` with a short, descriptive name. This is your working space. 
3. Document your development (i.e., any deviations from the original idea) by adding comments to the open issue.
4. Once you have completed the mod, submit a pull request with your branch. You may receive some comments/suggestions to your work. 
5. After resolving any issues with your branch, the project lead will merge with `main` and you will see your mod added to the project!
